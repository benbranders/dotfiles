# My dotfiles

It seemed like a good idea to keep my dotfiles on Github. All _cool_ geeks are doing it these days.

So what are you going to find here?

  1. .vimrc: I'm not (yet) a heavy Vim user, so don't expect anything special here.

# Instructions

## Vim

Add a symbolic link from the dotfils to .vimrc: 

    ln -s ~/git/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
